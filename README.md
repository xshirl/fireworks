# Firework Flowers

This is my final project for the La Guardia TechHire-General Assembly web development vestibule. It features flashing fireworks while a moon moves in the background and the words "Happy Lunar New Year" appear when a key is pressed, which rotates through the words. The project includes if statements, constructor functions, object literals, arrays, and moving shapes that reverse direction. 

It can be viewed at xshirl.github.io/fireworks.
